Dr. Muto: "Ah, I see you've returned from your explorations."

Dr. Muto: "What's this? You heard something about an experiment from someone in Zone Area 1?"

Dr. Muto: "That is interesting. We do all kinds of experiments here so I'm not sure what he's referring to."

Dr. Muto: "I've sent my assistant to Zone Area 2 for an experiment, maybe that's what he was talking about."

Dr. Muto: "You've proven yourself capable enough with Zone 1. Why don't you try meeting her in Zone 2 and asking her about it?"

Dr. Muto: "There could be something there that triggers your memories since you had no luck with Zone 1."

Dr. Muto: "You'll have to defeat the gate guard to gain entrance to Zone 2, but I'm sure you'll be fine."

Dr. Muto: "Now if you don't mind, I need to get back to my work here at the lab. Good luck, Zero!"
