Hello I am the peg leg scientist.

I am going to show you around.

Checkpoint: 1

These are insectosaurs.

They are genetically modified insects...

that are the size of dinosaurs.

I have been researching on how to train and fight these beasts.

I want you to have one to go and train and fight with.

Follow me.

Checkpoint: 5

These are all of the insectosaurs you have to choose from.

Choose wisely because you will have to go and...

fight with this insectosaur for the remainder of the game.

Once you choose your insectosaur, exit out of the main door...

To start your journey. Thanks and good luck!

End.
