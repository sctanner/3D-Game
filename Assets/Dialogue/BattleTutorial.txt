Assistant: "Thanks for meeting me here!"

Assistant: "Dr. Muto has instructed me to give you some more details about this world so you can better protect yourself."

Assistant: "You now know that we share this world with these amazing creatures we call Insectosaurs."

Assistant: "What you probably don't know is that even though they're dangerous, they can be quite shy. Insectosaurs often hide out in bushes and will attack you if you spook them!"

Assistant: "Not only that, but people you meet have their own Insectosaurs and may challenge you to a battle. You have to be careful who you talk to!"

Assistant: "If your Insectosaur is defeated in battle, you'll definitely be attacked next. I hate to say it, but since you just recovered you probably won't survive if that happens!"

Assistant: "To help prevent that, I'm going to teach you the basics of battle so you can better defend yourself."

Assistant: "Insectosaurs have two attacks that they can use while in combat. Each Insectosaur is different, so you'll have to figure out what moves each one has for yourself."

Assistant: "When battling, you should see a bar that represents each Insectosaur's health. Whoever gets to zero first is the loser, so please try to avoid that!"

Assistant: "We have developed an item that can heal your Insectosaur. You can heal both in and out of combat. These are precious, so choose carefully when to use them."

Assistant: "Here are some healing potions to get you started."

Assistant: "You can also choose to run away from a battle, but be warned, you can't run away from every fight!"

Assistant: "Just to give you a taste of what that's like, I'm going to challenge you to a battle right now! Don't worry, I'll go easy on you!"

-Assistant Katarina challenges you to a battle-

Assistant: "Well it seems like you've got the basics down enough that you can at least defend yourself."

Assistant: "If you're going to try and get your memories back, I suggest walking around the zone next to town. You may find something there that will trigger them."

Assistant: "Just speak to the guard in front of the gate. You'll have to prove yourself to him before you can pass. Good luck!"
