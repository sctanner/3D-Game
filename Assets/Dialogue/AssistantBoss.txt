Assistant: "Wow, I can't believe you made it all the way here!"

Assistant: "Zone 2 is supposed to be pretty tough. You must be quite the battler!"

Assistant: "Oh? You heard about an experiment from Zone Boss? I don't know why he calls himself that."

Assistant: "And then the doctor told you to meet me out here? Very interesting, I never can tell what he's thinking."

Assistant: "Well the information about the experiment is classified so if you want to know, you'll have to beat me first!"

Assistant: "And just a warning, I won't be taking it easy on you this time!"

-you are challenged to battle by Assistant-

Assistant: "Wow, you really are strong! The strongest I've seen so far!"

Assistant: "I guess I have no choice but to tell you the details of the experiment. . ."

Assistant: "See, what we're doing here right now. THAT'S the experiment. More precisely, YOU are the experiment!"

Assistant: "These Zones were set up to test your skills in real combat. We're trying to see just how viable you are as an Insectosaur battler."

Assistant: "The results are certainly promising. I bet the doctor will be so excited when you tell him you've passed with flying colors!"

Assistant: "Hurry back to the lab now. I'm sure you two will have so much to talk about!"
